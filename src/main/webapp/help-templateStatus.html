<div>
If "Active", Jenkins will try to create slaves from template during job execution.

You can set this field to "Disabled" if you want to temporarily suspend creation of slaves based on this template.
You can set this field to "Active Always", if you do not want Jenkins to disable template. Note that this setting may
create slaves in a loop if there are errors during provisioning.     

This field will be set to "Disabled" if there are any unrecoverable errors during provisioning which needs manual intervention.
