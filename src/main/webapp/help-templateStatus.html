<div>
If set to "Active until first failure", Jenkins will keep attempting to create slaves from the template during the job execution until the first unrecoverable error 
is encountered, at which point this setting will be automatically changed to "Disabled".

If set to "Disabled", the creation of slaves based on this template will be suspended. 

If set to "Active always", Jenkins will continue attempting to provision slaves based on this template regardless of any failures that may occur.  Note that this setting may
result in an excessive allocation of resources for the malfunctioning slaves. Such a continuous slave provisioning process can be stopped manually by changing the slave 
provisioning setting to "Disabled", or fixing the underlying issue causing the failures.
